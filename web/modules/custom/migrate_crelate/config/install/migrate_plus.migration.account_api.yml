# Migration file for creating "account" entities from CSV.
#
# This file contains much of the information which we
# used to specify in the "Migration" class in Drupal 7.
# But why write code if you can write YAML?
# This is how we declare a Migration the Drupal 8 way.

# Migration ID.
#
# Usually the ID indicates what we are trying to migrate.
# In our case, we are migrating nodes of type "program".
id: account_api
# Human-readable name of the migration for the UI.
label: Import Accounts from Crelate.com API
# Migration group.
#
# Migration groups allow us to put related migrations under one
# umbrella so that we can execute or reference them together.
migration_group: crelate_api
# Migration tags.
#
# Migration tags help us group migrations using tags. In our
# example, we tag all migrations with an "academic program"
# tag. That way, we can run all academic-program-related migrations
# using one command.
